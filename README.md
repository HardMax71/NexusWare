</p>



NexusWare is a cutting-edge, multi-platform Warehouse Management System designed to revolutionize inventory control,
order fulfillment, and warehouse operations. Built with Python and SQLite, NexusWare offers seamless integration
across mobile, web, and desktop environments.

> Although initial development idea was to use Flet lib, it was decided to split the project into separate projects
> for each platform.
