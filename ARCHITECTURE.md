## Security Considerations

1. Authentication: JWT-based authentication is used to secure API endpoints.
2. Authorization: Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented to restrict access to sensitive operations.
3. Data Encryption: All communication between clients and the server is encrypted using HTTPS.
4. Input Validation: Strict input validation is performed on both client and server-side to prevent injection attacks.
5. Rate Limiting: API rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.
6. Audit Logging: All critical operations are logged for auditing and compliance purposes.
