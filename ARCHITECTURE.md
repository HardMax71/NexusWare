## System Overview

NexusWare is a distributed system consisting of a central server and multiple client applications (mobile, web, and desktop). The system is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and secure.

## Component Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the high-level components of the NexusWare system:

## API Design
The NexusWare API follows RESTful principles and is organized into the following main resources:

* `/auth`: Authentication and user management
* `/inventory`: Inventory management
* `/orders`: Order processing and management
* `/shipments`: Shipment tracking and management
* `/reports`: Reporting and analytics

Each resource supports standard CRUD operations where applicable, using appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

## Security Considerations

1. Authentication: JWT-based authentication is used to secure API endpoints.
2. Authorization: Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented to restrict access to sensitive operations.
3. Data Encryption: All communication between clients and the server is encrypted using HTTPS.
4. Input Validation: Strict input validation is performed on both client and server-side to prevent injection attacks.
5. Rate Limiting: API rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.
6. Audit Logging: All critical operations are logged for auditing and compliance purposes.
